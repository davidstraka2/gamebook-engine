# Usage

Place your books into the examples directory (you can find some premade ones
already). Run `make run` to start the program. Choose "New game", enter filename
of the book you want to play and follow game instructions.

If you've already created a game, you can load an existing game by choosing
"Load game" in the main menu.

Run `make clean` to delete all generated files.

Run `make compile` to recompile, `make doc` to remake documentation, or
`make all`/`make` to do both.
